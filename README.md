## ✨ Why Choose This Template:

<img src="./apps/web/public/assets/Screen_Recording.gif" alt="Screen Recording" width="270" height="579">

This is not just another template; it's a production-ready, enterprise-grade foundation with 80%+ test coverage for modern full-stack development.
Originally a full-stack Next.js application [next-dnd-starter-kit](https://github.com/john-data-chen/next-dnd-starter-kit), it has been strategically re-architected into a decoupled frontend/backend system managed within a high-performance Monorepo.

Here's a quick comparison of the architectural evolution:

| Feature               | Old Architecture (Monolithic Next.js)      | **New Architecture (Decoupled Monorepo)**                                 | **Business & Team Impact**                                                                 |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Team Structure**    | Full-stack developers required             | **Specialized Frontend & Backend Teams**                                  | Allows hiring specialized talent; teams can work in parallel, increasing overall velocity. |
| **Development Cycle** | Tightly coupled; one change can impact all | **Independent development cycles**                                        | Reduces cross-team dependencies; frontend can iterate on UI without waiting for backend.   |
| **Deployment**        | Single, monolithic deployment              | **Independent Frontend/Backend deployment**                               | Faster, lower-risk deployments; a backend bug doesn't block a frontend release.            |
| **Scalability**       | Vertical scaling of the entire app         | **Targeted horizontal scaling** (e.g., scale only the API service)        | More cost-effective resource allocation; better performance under specific loads.          |
| **Technology Stack**  | Locked into Next.js for backend            | **Flexible backend choice (Nest.js)**; can add more services (Go, Python) | Future-proofs the architecture; enables using the best tool for each specific job.         |
| **Code Reusability**  | Limited to the Next.js app                 | **Centralized `ui` & `config` packages**                                  | Enforces design consistency and DRY principles across multiple potential applications.     |

This new architecture offers several key advantages:

- 🤝 Scalability & Team Agility: The decoupled structure, with a Next.js frontend and a Nest.js backend, allows teams to develop, test, and deploy independently, accelerating development cycles.
- 🚀 Optimized Developer Experience: Powered by Turbopack and Rspack for blazing-fast builds and leveraging Turborepo for intelligent caching and task orchestration, your development workflow will be faster than ever.
- 📦 Maximum Code Reusability: A centralized Shadcn UI component library is shared across the monorepo, ensuring design consistency and reducing redundant code.

**Key Accomplishments**:

- Strategic Backend Decoupling & Refactoring: Architected the separation of a full-stack Next.js application into a decoupled frontend and a robust backend. Rebuilt the entire backend with Nest.js, establishing a scalable, modular, and maintainable microservices-oriented architecture. This strategic move significantly improved development velocity and system scalability.
- Enhanced API & Data Integrity: Leveraged Nest.js powerful features, including dependency injection and a modular structure, to create a highly organized and testable API layer. This improved data validation and error handling, leading to a more resilient system.
- Elite Web Performance & Quality (Lighthouse 90+): Achieved scores of 90+ in Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO. The backend separation allowed the Next.js frontend to focus on optimized static site generation (SSG) and server-side rendering (SSR), leading to superior load times and a top-tier user experience.
- Comprehensive E2E Testing with Playwright: Implemented end-to-end tests for critical user flows, such as login, ensuring cross-browser (Chrome, Safari, Edge) and cross-platform reliability. This practice guarantees a consistent and dependable user experience.
- CI/CD & Live Deployment: Deployed to Vercel, providing a live, interactive demo. This showcases practical skills in modern deployment pipelines and delivering functional applications.

## 🛠️ Technical Decision

### Monorepo

[Turborepo](https://turborepo.org/) - A high-performance build system for JavaScript and TypeScript codebases. It was chosen to manage this monorepo for several key reasons:

- Faster, Smarter Builds: Turborepo dramatically speeds up development and CI/CD pipelines through advanced caching. It caches the output of tasks, ensuring code is never re-built or re-tested unnecessarily. This leads to near-instantaneous builds for unchanged code, a critical advantage for both developer productivity and deployment frequency.
- Simplified Monorepo Management: It provides a streamlined developer experience for managing shared packages (/packages), configurations (ESLint, TypeScript), and scripts from a single repository. This simplifies dependency management, promotes code reuse, and ensures consistency across the entire application stack (frontend and backend).
- Intelligent Task Scheduling: With its understanding of the dependency graph, Turborepo optimizes task execution by running them in the correct order and parallelizing where possible. This efficient scheduling minimizes idle time and further accelerates the entire build process.

### Frontend

- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - modern UI with strong type safety and server-side rendering (using SSG in login page for better performance, SSR in workspace pages for dynamic content)
- **Build**: [Oxlint](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/linter), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), [Commitizen](https://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/), [Lint Staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged), [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) - they are the 1st quality gate: automated code quality checks and style formatting during commit, preventing problems into codebase and make consistent code style in team work
- **UI**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Shadcn/UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) - consistent, responsive, and scalable styling, enabling rapid and maintainable UI development
- **Testing**: [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/), [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) - they are the 2nd quality gate: easier to setup and faster execution than Jest and Cypress, chosen for their efficiency and comprehensive testing capabilities
- **Internationalization(i18n)**: [Next-intl](https://next-intl.dev/) - internationalization (i18n) support for Next.js applications
- **State Management**: [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/) - minimal and testable global state management, 40% code reduction compared to Redux
- **Forms**: [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/), [Zod](https://zod.dev/) - composable form logic and schema validation.
- **Drag and Drop**: [dnd-kit](https://dndkit.com/) - A lightweight, performant, accessible and extensible drag & drop toolkit

### Backend

- **Framework**: [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) modern server-side application framework with strong type safety and performance
- **Build**: [Rspack](https://rspack.dev/) high-performance, Rust-based bundler designed for interoperability with the Webpack ecosystem. It delivers a 5-10x faster build speed compared to Webpack, dramatically reducing both development server startup and production build times.
- **Database**: [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) modern database with strong type safety and performance
- **Authentication**: [Passport](https://www.passportjs.org/), [JWT](https://jwt.io/) modern authentication with strong type safety and performance
- **Testing**: [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) modern testing with strong type safety and performance
- **CI/CD**: [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), [SonarQube](https://sonarcloud.io/), they are the 3rd quality gate: every pull request triggers a comprehensive pipeline, enforcing code quality gates and ensuring production-readiness through automated testing and deployment

### Database

- In production and CI, I use [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-database)
- In local development, I use [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) in folder **database**, you need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev/) installed.

### Environment Configuration

Local Development:

Create a `.env (.env.test for testing)` file in the project root with the following variables:

```text
# Application Environment
# Options: default: development | production | test: for testing
NODE_ENV=development

# Authentication Secret
# Required: A secure random string for JWT token encryption
# Generate: openssl rand -base64 32
# Warning: Keep this value private and unique per environment
JWT_SECRET=[your_secret]

# Database Connection
# Format: mongodb://[username]:[password]@[host]:[port]/[database]?[options]
# Required fields:
# - username: Database user with appropriate permissions (default: root)
# - password: User's password (default: 123456)
# - host: Database host (localhost for development)
# - port: MongoDB port (default: 27017)
# - database: Database name (REQUIRED: next-project-manager)
# - options: Additional connection parameters (default: authSource=admin)
#
# ⚠️  IMPORTANT: The database name MUST be included in the URL
# If omitted, MongoDB will default to "test" database
#
# Local MongoDB example:
# DATABASE_URL="mongodb://root:123456@localhost:27017/next-project-manager?authSource=admin"
#
# MongoDB Atlas (Cloud) example:
# DATABASE_URL="mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/next-project-manager?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
```

Production and CI:

Create environment variables in Vercel or GitHub project settings. **Ensure the database name is included in the DATABASE_URL** (e.g., `/next-project-manager` in the connection string).

### Useful Commands

## 🔐 Permission System

### Core Concepts

- Board can have multiple projects, it is the biggest container
- Project can have multiple tasks, it is the smallest container
- Each board has one owner and multiple members
- Tasks can be assigned to any member
- All modifications of a task are tracked with last modified user

### User Roles & Permissions

| Role         | Create Board | Delete Board | Edit All Projects | Delete Project (Cascade Tasks) | Create Project | Create Task | Edit All Tasks | Edit Own Task | Delete All Tasks | Delete Own Task | View All Projects & Tasks |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------- | ----------- | -------------- | ------------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |
| Board Owner  | ✔️           | ✔️           | ✔️                | ✔️                             | ✔️             | ✔️          | ✔️             | ✔️            | ✔️               | ✔️              | ✔️                        |
| Board Member | ✖️           | ✖️           | ✖️                | ✖️                             | ✔️             | ✔️          | ✖️             | ✔️            | ✖️               | ✔️              | ✔️                        |

> Note:
>
> - Board Owner has all permissions, including creating, deleting, and editing all projects and tasks.
> - Board Member can only create projects and tasks, and can only edit and delete their own projects and tasks, but can view all content.

### Task Operations

- Task creator and assignee can edit task
- Only owner of board, owner of project and creator of task can delete tasks
- Task status: To Do → In Progress → Done

## Experimental Tools

### Oxlint and Type-Aware plug-in

- status: enabled
- benefit:
  - 50~100 times faster than ESLint (it can lint this small project in 1.5 seconds, it has more potential in big projects with thousands of files)
  - easier to setup (compared to ESLint 9+)
  - clearer instructions showing how to fix each issue
  - many ESLint packages can be removed (in my case 10 packages)
- note: Oxlint is in a stable version, and many companies have used it in production for a long time.
  But Type-Aware plug-in is still in a preview version. It is not recommended to use it in production, and it is a experimental in this project

#### Introductions

- [Oxlint](https://oxc.rs/blog/2025-06-10-oxlint-stable.html)
- [Oxlint Type-Aware Preview](https://oxc.rs/blog/2025-08-17-oxlint-type-aware.html)

### Turbopack

- location: apps/web (Next.js)
- enabled in default (Next.js 16)
- benefit: the Rust-based successor of webpack by Vercel, offers near-instantaneous server startup and lightning-fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR). This is achieved through its incremental architecture, which caches function-level computations, ensuring we only build what's necessary.
- [introduction](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/turbopack)

#### Turbopack File System Caching (beta)

- location: apps/web (Next.js)
- status: enabled
- benefit: Turbopack now supports filesystem caching in development, storing compiler artifacts on disk between runs for significantly faster compile times across restarts, especially in large projects.
- [introduction](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-16#turbopack-file-system-caching-beta)

### Rspack

- location: apps/api
- status: enabled
- benefit: Rspack is a high-performance, Rust-based bundler designed for interoperability with the Webpack ecosystem. It delivers a 5-10x faster build speed compared to Webpack, dramatically reducing both development server startup and production build times.
- [introduction](https://rspack.rs/guide/start/introduction)

### Prettier oxc plugin

- status: disabled (it is conflict with vs code auto formatting, since this is a small project, the speed difference is not significant)
- benefit: Increase Prettier formatting speed
- [introduction](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@prettier/plugin-oxc)

### React Compiler

- location: apps/web (Next.js)
- status: disabled (enable it will increase build time 30~40%, so I disable it)
- benefit: It can increase the performance score in lighthouse test 5~10% (not significant)
- [introduction](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler)

## Known Issues & Limitations

### German Translations

This is a demo project, and I know little of German, so errors of translations might not be fixed in the near future.

### Server

- **Slow response from server**:
  - Server Region: Hong Kong
  - Issue: Sometimes Server response is slow, such as you can't search user when you add a task then find the assigner, especially for users are not in Asia (in local dev server, I tested it works fine)
  - Reason:
    - The resource of free tier is limited.
    - In this monorepo project, the backend is separated from the original Next.js App into Nest.js app, the response between two services is longer.
  - Solution: I don't have plan for a demo project to upgrade paid tier or CDN, so it won't be fixed in the near future.
